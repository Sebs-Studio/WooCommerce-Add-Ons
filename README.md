What is WooCommerce Add-Ons ?

WooCommerce Add-Ons is an open community plugin to add small pieces of code that offer new filters, options and abilities.

The plugin is designed to apply additional functions that have not been added in the core of WooCommerce and to expand on what’s already there.

It's also a great plugin to help developers generate custom settings for their own WooCommerce plugin.

How can I add take part ?
